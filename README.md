## üöÄ Welcome to Your First AI/ML Open Source Contribution!

This repository is an excellent starting point for anyone looking to merge **Machine Learning** with **Web Development**. We've built a real-time **Face Detection Attendance System** using **Python**, the **Flask** web framework, and the **OpenCV** library.

Join us to learn how to build a practical AI application from the ground up, all while participating in Hacktoberfest 2025! ü§ù

### Why Contribute to This Project?

| Skill You'll Learn | Feature You'll Touch | Relevant File |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Full-Stack ML Deployment** | Set up and run a Flask web application | `app.py` |
| **Computer Vision** | Integrate OpenCV for real-time face detection | `app.py` |
| **Data Handling** | Read and write attendance data to CSV files | `app.py` |
| **Frontend/UI** | Customize the attendance dashboard interface | `templates/home.html` |

---

## üéØ Project Features & Core Technologies

This system uses a combination of classic CV techniques and simple machine learning for efficient, real-time attendance marking.

### Key Features:
* **Real-Time Face Recognition:** Uses the host machine's webcam to instantly detect and recognize users.
* **Simple User Registration:** Captures a set of face images (50 frames) for a new user to train the recognition model.
* **Daily Attendance Records:** Automatically logs attendance with Name, Roll ID, and Time into a timestamped CSV file (e.g., `Attendance/Attendance-10_08_25.csv`).
* **Web Dashboard:** Displays today's attendance sheet on the web interface.

### Tech Stack:
| Component | Technology | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Web Framework | **Flask** | Routing and serving the web dashboard. |
| Computer Vision | **OpenCV** | Video streaming, face extraction (`extract_faces`), and Haar Cascade face detection. |
| Face Recognition | **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** | Classifies the detected face using a trained model (`face_recognition_model.pkl`). |
| Data Processing | **Pandas** | Managing attendance data in CSV files. |

## üõ†Ô∏è Run This Project Locally (Quick Setup)

Follow these steps to get your local development environment ready:

### 1. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python installed (Python 3.x recommended)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the Flask Application
```Bash

python app.py
```
3. Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

> **Note:** Make sure you have the required **`haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`** file and a pre-trained model **`static/face_recognition_model.pkl`** (or run user registration to generate one) for the system to function.

## üí° How to Contribute (A Beginner's Guide)

We welcome all contributions\! Here are the simple steps to make your first Pull Request:

### Contribution Steps

1.  **Fork** this repository.
2.  **Clone** your fork:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)<your-username>/yesiamrajeev.git
    cd yesiamrajeev
    ```
3.  **Create a New Branch**:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b fix/your-issue-name
    ```
4.  **Make Your Changes** (See contribution ideas below).
5.  **Commit** your changes and **Push** to your fork.
6.  Open a **Pull Request** to the `main` branch of the original repository.

### Beginner Contribution Ideas:

  * **Frontend Magic (HTML/CSS):** Improve the layout, styling, and responsiveness of the dashboard in `templates/home.html`.
  * **Documentation:** Enhance this `README.md` or add comments/docstrings to complex functions in `app.py` (e.g., `train_model`, `identify_face`).
  * **Feature Enhancement (Python):** Add a feature to delete registered users/folders (e.g., improve the `deletefolder` function).
  * **Error Handling:** Add more robust `try...except` blocks, especially around OpenCV camera calls or file operations.
  * **Refactoring:** Optimize the data retrieval/attendance functions like `extract_attendance`.

## ‚úÖ Mandatory for PR Approval

To ensure your contribution is verified and can be merged, you **must** provide the following:

1.  **Screenshot(s):** At least one screenshot showing:
    - Your code changes running successfully.
    - The Flask app‚Äôs UI or output (e.g., detected faces, attendance mark screen).

2.  **Screen Recording:** A short video (10‚Äì30 seconds) demonstrating your changes working live in the application.

    You can provide the video by:
    - Uploading the `.mp4` file inside the `/static/demo/` folder and linking it in your PR description.
    - **OR** providing a public link (e.g., Google Drive, Loom, YouTube) in your PR description.
